You will not find any of the code in the codes section but I made a game on Scratch of which I am giving you link -
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1159548441/
In this game you have a joystick to control a cat. Move the cat to the end (The house) through the tunnel. If you touch the tunnel you have to start over.
Feel free to remix the code just don't mess it up it took a long time to build.
Thank you 
            Regards Gerado
